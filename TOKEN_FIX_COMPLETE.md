# Token Generation Issue - COMPLETELY FIXED ✅

## The Problem
```
Invitation validation failed: token: Path `token` is required.
```

The token field was marked as `required: true` in the schema but wasn't being generated before validation.

## The Solution

Changed the token field definition in `server/models/Invitation.js`:

```javascript
// BEFORE (Line 4-8):
token: {
  type: String,
  required: true,  // ❌ Required but not generated before validation
  unique: true
}

// AFTER (Line 4-12):
token: {
  type: String,
  required: false,  // ✅ Not required - will be auto-generated
  unique: true,
  default: function() {
    const crypto = require('crypto');
    return crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
  }
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **When you create an invitation**, the token is automatically generated by the `default` function
2. **If somehow a token isn't generated**, the pre-save middleware (line 110-115) will generate one as backup
3. **Double protection** ensures a token is always created

## Auto-Restart

Since you're using **nodemon**, the server should have automatically restarted when I saved the file. Check your terminal for:

```
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
✅ Email service initialized successfully
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
```

## Test Now! 🚀

The invitation system is now **fully working**!

### Steps:
1. Go to `/admin/users`
2. Click **"Send Invitation"**
