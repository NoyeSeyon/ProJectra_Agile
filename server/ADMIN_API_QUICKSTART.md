  newUserEmail: 'testuser@example.com'
};
```

### Step 2: Run Tests
```bash
cd server
node tests/test-admin-workflow.js
```

### Step 3: View Results
- Tests run automatically
- Color-coded output
- Success rate displayed
- Detailed error messages

---

## Method 3: Using cURL

### Step 1: Login and Get Token
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "USER_ID_FROM_STEP_2",

  }'
```

### Step 4: Get All PMs

## Common HTTP Status Codes

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request (validation error)
- `401` - Unauthorized (no/invalid token)
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not Found
- `500` - Internal Server Error

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Access denied. No token provided"
**Solution:** Include Authorization header with Bearer token

### Error: "Admin access required"
**Solution:** Ensure logged-in user has 'admin' role

### Error: "User does not belong to your organization"
**Solution:** Can only manage users in same organization

### Error: "User is already a Project Manager"
**Solution:** Check user's current role before assigning

### Error: "Cannot remove PM role. User has N active project(s)"
**Solution:** Reassign active projects before removing PM role

### Error: "Cannot set capacity to X. PM has Y active projects"
**Solution:** Capacity must be >= active projects count

Use the invite endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/admin/users/invite \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

    "lastName": "Member1",
    "role": "member"

## Performance Notes

- All endpoints respond within 100-500ms (local)
- Database queries are optimized with indexes
- Pagination not yet implemented (coming in Day 5)
- Real-time notifications via Socket.io ready

---

## Security Reminders

1. Always use HTTPS in production
2. Rotate JWT secrets regularly
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Log all admin actions
5. Send temp passwords via email only
6. Implement MFA for admin accounts

---

## Next Steps

After testing backend:
1. Proceed to Day 4 (Admin Frontend)
2. Create UI for all endpoints
3. Add data visualization
4. Implement real-time updates
5. Add confirmation dialogs
