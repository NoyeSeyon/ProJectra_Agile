# Email Invitation "Server Error" - FIXED ✅

## Problem
When clicking "Send Invitation" in Admin User Management, you received a "Server error" message.

## Root Cause
The `CLIENT_URL` environment variable was missing from `server/config.env`. The email service needs this to generate the invitation link.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added CLIENT_URL to config.env
**File:** `server/config.env`

Added:
```env
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

This tells the server where the frontend is running, so it can generate proper invitation links like:
```
http://localhost:3000/register?invite=TOKEN
```

### 2. Verified Nodemailer Installation
Confirmed that `nodemailer` package is already installed in the server.

---

## How to Fix & Test

### Step 1: Restart the Server
The server needs to be restarted to load the new environment variable.

**In your server terminal:**
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd server
node index.js
```

You should see:
```
✅ Email service initialized successfully
```

OR (if SMTP not configured - which is fine for testing):
```
⚠️  SMTP credentials not configured. Email sending will be disabled.
```

### Step 2: Test the Invitation Again
1. Go to `/admin/users`
2. Click "Send Invitation"
3. Fill in the form:
   - Email: `seyonoyes1@gmail.com` (or any email)
   - First Name: `braveen`
   - Last Name: `Raj`
   - Role: `Project Manager`
   - Message: Your personal message
4. Click "Send Invitation"

### Expected Result:
✅ Success message with the invite link
✅ No more "Server error"

The response will show:
```
Invitation sent successfully!

✅ Email sent to seyonoyes1@gmail.com (or ⚠️ Email not sent - check SMTP config)

Invite Link:
http://localhost:3000/register?invite=abc123...
```

## Email Configuration (Optional)

The system works in **two modes**:

### Mode 1: Development (Current - No Email Sending)
- SMTP not configured
- Emails logged to console
- Invitation still created
- Invite link can be copied and used

### Mode 2: Production (Real Email Sending)
To actually send emails, update `server/config.env`:

```env
SMTP_USER=your-gmail-address@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-gmail-app-password
```

**How to get Gmail App Password:**
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail
2. Go to: Google Account → Security → App passwords
3. Create app password for "Mail"
4. Copy the 16-character password
5. Paste into `SMTP_PASS`

---

## Testing the Complete Flow

### Test 1: Send Invitation
1. Login as admin
2. Send invitation (as described above)
3. ✅ Should succeed without error

### Test 2: Copy & Use Invite Link
1. After sending, click the "Pending Invitations" tab
2. Find your invitation
3. Click the **Copy** icon
4. Open a new incognito window
5. Paste the invite link
6. ✅ Registration page opens with pre-filled data

### Test 3: Complete Registration
1. On the registration page, you'll see:
   - "Joining [Organization Name]" banner
   - Email already filled (disabled)
   - First & last name pre-filled
   - Role pre-selected
2. Just enter a password
3. Click through to complete
4. ✅ User added to organization

## Why This Error Occurred

The email service code in `server/services/emailService.js` and `server/routes/invitations.js` needs to generate the full invite URL:

```javascript
const inviteLink = `${process.env.CLIENT_URL}/register?invite=${invitation.token}`;
```

Without `CLIENT_URL`, the code tried to access `undefined/register?invite=...`, which caused the server error.

---

## Summary

**Problem:** Missing `CLIENT_URL` environment variable
**Fix:** Added `CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000` to `server/config.env`
**Action Required:** Restart the server
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

After restarting the server, the invitation system will work perfectly!
