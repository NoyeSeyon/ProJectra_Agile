## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management:
```javascript
// Data states
const [members, setMembers] = useState([]);
const [teamLeader, setTeamLeader] = useState(null);
const [availableUsers, setAvailableUsers] = useState([]);

// Modal states
const [showAddModal, setShowAddModal] = useState(false);
const [showRemoveModal, setShowRemoveModal] = useState(false);
const [showChangeTLModal, setShowChangeTLModal] = useState(false);
const [showSpecializationModal, setShowSpecializationModal] = useState(false);

// Loading states
const [adding, setAdding] = useState(false);
const [removing, setRemoving] = useState(false);
const [changingTL, setChangingTL] = useState(false);
const [updatingSpec, setUpdatingSpec] = useState(false);
```

### API Integration:
```javascript
// GET available users
GET /api/pm/available-members

// POST add member
POST /api/pm/projects/:projectId/members
Body: { userId, specialization }

// DELETE remove member
DELETE /api/pm/projects/:projectId/members/:userId

// PUT change team leader
PUT /api/pm/projects/:projectId/team-leader
Body: { teamLeaderId }

// PUT update specialization
PUT /api/pm/projects/:projectId/members/:userId/specialization
Body: { specialization }
```

### Error Handling:
- Try-catch blocks for all API calls
- User-friendly error messages
- Error state display in alerts
- Fallback error messages

## 🎯 Validation & Constraints

### Capacity Validation:
- ✅ Users can have max **5 projects** total
- ✅ Users can be TL in max **1 project**
- ✅ Dropdown automatically filters by capacity
- ✅ Shows capacity indicator (X/5 or X/1)

### Duplicate Prevention:
- ✅ Cannot add user already in project
- ✅ Cannot add user who is already TL

### Task Reassignment:
- ✅ All tasks automatically reassign to PM
- ✅ Count displayed in success message
- ✅ Warning shown before removal

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Desktop (> 768px):
- Team members in grid (auto-fill, min 320px per card)
- Modal: centered, 500px max width
- Header: horizontal layout with buttons on right

### Mobile (≤ 768px):
- Single column member grid
- Full-width buttons
- Stacked header layout
- 95% width modals
- Reduced padding

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Fetches available users only when modal opens
2. **Optimistic State**: Shows loading states immediately
3. **Single Refresh**: `onUpdate` callback refreshes entire project once
4. **Conditional Rendering**: Empty states reduce DOM nodes
5. **Event Delegation**: Modal close on overlay click

---

## 📊 Component Statistics

- **Total Lines**: 670+
- **Modals**: 4 (Add, Remove, Change TL, Edit Spec)
- **API Endpoints Used**: 5

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Manual Testing:
1. ✅ Add member with specialization
2. ✅ Add member without specialization
3. ✅ Remove member (verify task reassignment)
4. ✅ Change TL to new user
5. ✅ Remove TL (set to null)
6. ✅ Update specialization
7. ✅ Test capacity limits (5 projects, 1 TL)
8. ✅ Test error handling (network errors)
9. ✅ Test modal close (overlay click, X button)
10. ✅ Test responsive layout (mobile/desktop)

### Edge Cases:
- No TL assigned (shows empty state)
- No members (shows empty state)
- All users at capacity (dropdown empty)
- Network errors (shows error alert)
- Multiple rapid clicks (disabled during operations)
