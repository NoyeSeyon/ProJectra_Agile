# ✅ Team Page Fixed - Current User Removed!

## 🎯 What Changed

### **Before:**
- Team page showed **ALL team members** including the logged-in user
- User could see their own card in the team list
- Confusing UI showing "you" as a team member

### **After:**
- Team page shows **ONLY other team members**
- Current user's card is **filtered out**
- Clean UI showing just your teammates

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Changes Made:**

1. **Added `useAuth` hook:**
   ```javascript
   import { useAuth } from '../../contexts/AuthContext';
   const { user } = useAuth();
   ```

2. **Filter logic:**
   ```javascript
   const currentUserId = user?._id || user?.id;
   
   // Skip current user when collecting members
   if (member.user._id === currentUserId) {
     return; // Don't add to list
   }
   
   // Skip current user if they're the team leader
   if (tlId === currentUserId) {
     return; // Don't add to list
   }
   ```

## 📋 **What You'll See Now**

### **Team Members Page:**

**Before:**
```
Team Members                    2 members
┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐
│ Noyes Kokulan│  │ Anuu raaaa   │
│ (YOU)        │  │              │
│ Data Scientist│  │ Software Eng │
└──────────────┘  └──────────────┘
```

**After:**
```
Team Members                    1 member
┌──────────────┐
│ Anuu raaaa   │
│              │
│ Software Eng │
└──────────────┘
```

*(Your own card is removed)*

## ✅ **Smart Filtering**

### **Handles Both Roles:**
- ✅ Filters you out if you're a **regular member**
- ✅ Filters you out if you're a **Team Leader**
- ✅ Shows only **other people** in your projects

### **Works with Multiple ID Formats:**
- Handles `user._id`
- Handles `user.id`
- Works with MongoDB ObjectId strings
