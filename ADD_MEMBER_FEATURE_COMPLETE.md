## How It Works

### Step 1: User Clicks "Add Member"
1. Button triggers `handleOpenAddMemberModal()`
2. Modal opens with loading spinner
3. Fetches two API endpoints in parallel:
   - `GET /api/pm/projects` - PM's projects
   - `GET /api/pm/available-members` - Available users

### Step 2: User Selects Project
1. Dropdown shows all PM's projects
2. Shows current member count vs max team size
3. Example: "Project Alpha (3/10 members)"

### Step 3: User Selects Members
1. User cards displayed in grid
2. Each card shows:
   - Avatar with initials
   - Name and email
   - Specialization badge (if not general)
   - Capacity: current/max projects (color-coded)
3. Click card to select/deselect
4. Selected cards show:
   - Blue border
   - Blue gradient background
   - Green checkmark badge
5. Label updates: "Select Members * (3 selected)"

### Step 4: Submit
1. Validation: Must select project and at least one member
2. Loops through selected users
3. Calls `POST /api/pm/projects/:projectId/members` for each
4. Counts successes
5. Shows alert: "Successfully added 3 member(s) to the project"
6. Closes modal
7. Refreshes member list

## Capacity Validation

### Visual Indicators
- **Normal (< 80%):** Green badge

Example: `3/5` (green), `4/5` (yellow), `5/5` (red)

## Integration with Existing Features
