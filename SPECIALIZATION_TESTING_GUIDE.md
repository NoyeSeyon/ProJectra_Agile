## üîç Database Verification Queries

Use these MongoDB queries to verify data integrity:

### Check User Specializations
```javascript
db.users.find(
  { role: { $in: ['member', 'team_leader'] } },
  { firstName: 1, lastName: 1, role: 1, specialization: 1, _id: 0 }
).pretty()
```

### Check Invitation Metadata
```javascript
db.invitations.find(
  { status: 'pending' },
  { email: 1, role: 1, 'metadata.specialization': 1, _id: 0 }
).pretty()
```

### Count Users by Specialization
```javascript
db.users.aggregate([
  { $match: { role: { $in: ['member', 'team_leader'] } } },
  { $group: { _id: '$specialization', count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { count: -1 } }
])
```

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No bulk specialization update:** Admins cannot update specializations for multiple users at once
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No specialization history:** System doesn't track when/how specializations were changed
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No specialization matching:** System doesn't suggest best-fit members based on task requirements

### Future Enhancements (Phase 6+):
- üîÆ Smart task assignment based on specialization matching
- üîÆ Specialization-based analytics and reports
- üîÆ Workload balancing by specialization
- üîÆ Skill matrix visualization
- üîÆ Bulk update for admin

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: Specialization not showing in dropdown**

- **Fix:** Specialization only available for members and team leaders

**Issue 2: Specialization filter not working**
- **Cause:** Frontend filter state not updating
- **Fix:** Check browser console for errors, refresh page

**Issue 3: Specialization not persisting**
- **Cause:** Backend validation error or database constraint
- **Fix:** Check terminal logs for validation errors

**Issue 4: Email not sending**
- **Cause:** SMTP credentials incorrect in `.env`
- **Fix:** Verify `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASS`, `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`
